    👋 Hi there! I'm **Xianglong** (Or my English name **Sean**) **Xu**, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh, with a focus on AI. My academic journey began at North China Electric Power University, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Intelligent Science and Technology from the Computer Science department.

    🧠 My expertise lies in several machine learning algorithms, and I'm proficient in programming languages such as Python and R. I thrive on collaboration and am known for being outgoing. Fluent in English (with a score of 8 in IELTS Speaking), I easily connect with people from diverse cultures, fostering open communication and effective teamwork.

    ⚽ Outside the world of tech, I'm passionate about soccer. Beyond the excitement it brings, soccer has instilled in me a spirit of perseverance and resilience.

    🌐 I'm always open to connecting with like-minded professionals, discussing AI, or exploring potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via email at xix@pitt.edu or Sean65039@gmail.com. You can also connect with me directly on LinkedIn.

          - Utilizing jieba segmentation and part-of-speech tagging for text processing. Accomplished data preprocessing and sequence conversion.
          - Constructing a vocabulary using a statistical word frequency approach. Incorporating stop-word filtering to enhance the model's robustness.
          - Implemented a text classification model using `PyTorch`, inheriting from the nn.Module class. The model incorporates an embedding layer (nn.Embedding), an LSTM layer (nn.LSTM), and a fully connected layer (nn.Linear). To prevent overfitting, a Dropout layer (nn.Dropout) is included. The model processes input sequences through forward propagation (forward method) to produce classification predictions.
          - Trained using Tencent AI Lab's word embeddings, the model achieves a test set accuracy exceeding 95%.

          - Employed `ggplot` for crafting insightful visualizations to elucidate complex relationships and input distributions.
          - Utilized the `lm()` function for MLE modeling and rstanarm's `stan_lm()` for Bayesian modeling in both regression and classification tasks. Applied the `glmet` package to fit models with Lasso regularization techniques, enhancing robustness. Leveraged the `caret` package for training a variety of machine learning models, including Random Forest, Neural Network, SVM, and XGBoost, with a focus on model tuning for optimal performance.
          - Employed a meticulous evaluation of diverse metrics to discern and select the best-performing models for both regression and classification tasks.

          - Proposed a YOLOv7-based model for vehicle detection, trained & validated with UA-DETRAC dataset.
          - Adopted a frame sampling strategy (2 frames for training, 10 frames for validation) to mitigate overfitting risks in a 25 fps video dataset. Innovatively included random test set folders in training to improve model adaptability and handle distribution differences.
          - Successfully deployed the optimized model on Android, utilizing the NCNN open-source framework from GitHub. This ensures efficient and resource-friendly execution on mobile devices.

      Apart from **studying**, my greatest passion lies in **exploring the unknown**. I love delving into **diverse cultures**, aspiring to travel far and wide, and engage as much as possible with the **local communities**. Along the way, I also indulge in **photography**, using the language of the lens to articulate my understanding of the world.
