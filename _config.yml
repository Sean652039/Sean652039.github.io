    👋 Hi there! I'm **Xianglong Xu**, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh, with a focus on AI. My academic journey began at North China Electric Power University, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science - Specialization in AI.

    🧠 My expertise lies in several machine learning algorithms, and I'm proficient in programming languages such as Python and R. I thrive on collaboration and am known for being outgoing. Fluent in English (with a score of 8 in IELTS Speaking), I easily connect with people from diverse cultures, fostering open communication and effective teamwork.

    ⚽ Outside the world of tech, I'm passionate about soccer. Beyond the excitement it brings, soccer has instilled in me a spirit of perseverance and resilience.

    🌐 I'm always open to connecting with like-minded professionals, discussing AI, or exploring potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via email at xix110@pitt.edu or Sean65039@gmail.com. You can also connect with me directly on LinkedIn.

          - Designed and implemented a dual-model music generation system that leverages Stable Diffusion and Restricted Boltzmann Machines for generating roll plots from music MIDI files, which are then converted to MIDI files.
          - Preprocessed plots for training by truncating the x-axis representing time, expanding the y-axis (music pitch range) by replicating pitch rows to match input dimensions, and applying color-coding to increase dimensions.
          - Designed a Stable Diffusion training pipeline using a UNet2DModel with adaptive pixel-wise weighted loss, dynamic noise scheduling, and checkpoint management, with architecture aligned to the preprocessing of plots.
          - Designed an RBM for denoising, treating each pixel as a visible node with a hidden layer of half the visible nodes, while incorporating adaptive noise generation, multi-type noise injection, and contrastive divergence training.
          - Engineered an image-to-MIDI conversion pipeline that transforms generated plots into binary representations through adaptive thresholding, translating pixel data into MIDI note sequences with time and pitch mapping.

          - Optimized a reinforcement learning AI agent for the ’Snake’ game using Proximal Policy Optimization with MLP and CNN architectures, enhancing the reward-punishment mechanism and achieving a 5% score improvement.
          - Engineered a Markov chain model to analyze the game process by treating each time step as a Markov state, suggesting that compressing the snake’s body to reduce the space it occupies is one potential optimization.
          - Developed a recursive territory calculation algorithm inspired by Go game rules to compute the empty cells enclosed by the snake’s body, using the number of enclosed cells as a penalty criterion to train the agent.

      #     - Utilizing jieba segmentation and part-of-speech tagging for text processing. Accomplished data preprocessing and sequence conversion.
      #     - Constructing a vocabulary using a statistical word frequency approach. Incorporating stop-word filtering to enhance the model's robustness.
      #     - Implemented a text classification model using PyTorch, inheriting from the nn.Module class. The model incorporates an embedding layer (nn.Embedding), an LSTM layer (nn.LSTM), and a fully connected layer (nn.Linear). To prevent overfitting, a Dropout layer (nn.Dropout) is included. The model processes input sequences through forward propagation (forward method) to produce classification predictions.
      #     - Trained using Tencent AI Lab's word embeddings, the model achieves a test set accuracy exceeding 95%.

      Apart from studying, my greatest passion lies in exploring the unknown. I love delving into diverse cultures, aspiring to travel far and wide, and engage as much as possible with the local communities. Along the way, I also indulge in photography, using the language of the lens to articulate my understanding of the world.
